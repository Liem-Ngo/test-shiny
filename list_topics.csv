Angular momentum is the rotational counterpart of momentum. A spinning flywheel has angular momentum.
In a closed system angular momentum is constant. The conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an ice skater as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is constant the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater has to increase.

A type of chemical mixture where one substance is dispersed evenly throughout another. The particles of the dispersed substance are only suspended in the mixture, unlike a solution, where they are completely dissolved within.

Permittivity is determined by the ability of a material to polarize in response to the field, and thereby reduce the total electric field inside the material. Thus, permittivity relates to a material's ability to transmit (or 'permit') an electric field.

There are three basic steps in the fluid acceleration process: ionize air molecules, use those ions to push many more neutral molecules in a desired direction, and then recapture and neutralize the ions to eliminate any net charge.
"A redistribution of electrical charge in an object, caused by the influence of nearby charges. Electrostatic generators, such as the Wimshurst machine, the Van de Graaff generator and the electrophorus, use this principle.

An object with constant mass will accelerate in proportion to the net force acting upon it and in inverse proportion to its mass (or the net force on an object is equal to the rate of change of momentum it experiences). Forces acting on objects may cause them to rotate or deform, or result in a change in pressure.

The emission of light from the fracture (rather than rubbing) of a crystal. Depending upon the atomic and molecular composition of the crystal, when the crystal fractures a charge separation can occur making one side of the fractured crystal +ve charged and the other side -ve charged.

(or freeze-gelation) A sol-gel process for making complex ceramic objects without high temperature sintering. Usually a silica sol is mixed with filler powder. A wetting agent disperses the filler in the sol, to make a thixotropic mix that liquifies when vibrated in a mould, freeing  trapped air. Freezing the mould causes the silica to precipitate from the sol, making a gel that binds the filler like a sintering greenform which is furnace-dried.

A phase change in which a liquid turns into a solid when its temperature is lowered below its freezing point. Colloquially it is applied to water, but technically it applies to any liquid. All known liquids, except liquid helium, freeze when the temperature is lowered enough.
(or near-field diffraction) A process of diffraction which occurs when a wave passes through an aperture and diffracts in the near field, causing any diffraction pattern observed to differ in size and shape, depending on the distance between the aperture and the projection. It occurs due to the short distance in which the diffracted waves propagate. When the distance is increased, outgoing diffracted waves become planar and Fraunhofer diffraction occurs.
A lens using less material compared to a conventional spherical lens by breaking the lens into a set of concentric annular sections. For each of these, the overall thickness of the lens is decreased, breaking the continuous surface of a standard lens into a set of surfaces of the same curvature, with discontinuities between them. This reduces the thickness (and weight and volume) of the lens, at the expense of reducing the imaging quality.
The force resisting the relative motion of two surfaces in contact or a surface in contact with a fluid (e.g. air on an aircraft or water in a pipe).
"A dimensionless scalar value which describes the ratio of the force of friction between two bodies and the force pressing them together.

A class of solid-state welding processes that generates heat through mechanical friction between a moving workpiece and a stationary component, with the addition of a lateral force called 'upset' to plastically displace and fuse the materials. Technically, because no melt occurs, friction welding is not actually a welding process in the traditional sense, but a forging technique.
A process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic. Finely ground raw material is mixed with water to form a slurry. The desired mineral is rendered hydrophobic by the addition of a surfactant or collector chemical. The slurry is there areated (e.g by air or nitrogen). The hydrophobic particles attach to the air bubbles, which rise to the surface, forming a froth which can be removed for further refining.
An electrochemical conversion device. It produces electricity from fuel (on the anode side) and an oxidant (on the cathode side), which react in the presence of an electrolyte.

Compressors are similar to pumps: both increase the pressure on a fluid and both can transport the fluid through a pipe. As gases are compressible, the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas. Liquids are relatively incompressible, so the main action of a pump is to transport liquids.
(or Bubble Pump) A device that raises a fluid (such as water or oil) by introducing bubbles of compressed gas (such as air or water vapour) into the outlet tube. This has the effect of reducing the hydrostatic pressure in the outlet tube vs. the hydrostatic pressure at the inlet side of the tube.
A gear (or more correctly a gear wheel) is a rotating machine part having cut teeth, or cogs, which mesh with another toothed part in order to transmit torque.

A gel is a solid, jelly-like material that can have properties ranging from soft and weak to hard and tough. Gels are defined as a substantially dilute crosslinked system, which exhibits no flow when in the steady-state. By weight, gels are mostly liquid, yet they behave like solids due to a three-dimensional crosslinked network within the liquid. It is the crosslinks within the fluid that give a gel its structure (hardness) and contribute to stickiness (tack).
(or Maltese cross) is a gear mechanism that translates a continuous rotation into an intermittent rotary motion. The rotating drive wheel has a pin that reaches into a slot of the driven wheel advancing it by one step.

An optical phenomenon in which linearly polarised light undergoes a small shift, parallel to the direction of propagation, when totally internally reflected. This effect is the linear polarisation analog of the Imbert-Fedorov effect. This occurs because the reflections of a finite sized beam will interfere along a line transverse to the average propagation direction.
A method of strengthening materials by changing their average crystallite (grain) size. It is based on the observation that grain boundaries impede dislocation movement and that the number of dislocations within a grain have an effect on how easily dislocations can traverse grain boundaries and travel from grain to grain. Changing grain size can influence dislocation movement and yield strength.

The position of the interference fringes is dependent on the angular velocity of the setup. The basis of ring interferometry.
A mixing process that occurs when relatively warm, salty water overlies relatively colder, fresher water. It is driven by the fact that heated water diffuses more readily than salty water. A small parcel of warm, salty water sinking downwards into a colder, fresher region will lose its heat before losing its salt, making the parcel of water increasingly denser than the water around it and sinking further. Likewise, a small parcel of colder, fresher water will be displaced upwards and gain heat by diffusion from surrounding water, which will then make it lighter than the surrounding waters, and cause it to rise further.
A specific type of particle transport by fluids such as wind, or the denser fluid water. It occurs when loose material is removed from a bed and carried by the fluid, before being transported back to the surface.

It entails impacting a surface with shot (round metallic, glass or ceramic particles) with force sufficient to create plastic deformation. It is similar to sandblasting, except that it operates by the mechanism of plasticity rather than abrasion. In practice, this means that less material is removed by the process, and less dust created.

This results in a gas (or liquified gas) that is colder than the original and at the same pressure.
A method for making objects from powder, by heating the material below its melting point (solid state sintering) until its particles adhere to each other.  Traditionally used for manufacturing ceramic objects. Most, if not all, metals can be sintered - especially pure metals produced in vacuum which suffer no surface contamination.

(or Field Assisted Sintering Technique (FAST) or Pulsed Electric Current Sintering (PECS)). The main characteristic of the Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) is that the pulsed DC current directly passes through the graphite die, as well as the powder compact, in case of conductive samples. Therefore, the heat is generated internally which facilitates a very high heating or cooling rate (up to 1000k/min), hence the sintering process generally is very fast (within a few minutes).

An oscillator for which the displacing and restoring force is a torque (i.e. rotational) rather than linear (such as for a mass suspended by a spring). A balance spring is a good example.
A flexible elastic object that stores mechanical energy when it is twisted. The amount of force (actually torque) it exerts is proportional to the amount it is twisted. A torsion spring is often made from a wire, ribbon, or bar of metal or rubber, while more delicate ones are made of silk, glass, or quartz fibers.
An optical phenomenon that occurs when a ray of light strikes a medium boundary at an angle larger than a particular critical angle with respect to the normal to the surface. If the refractive index is lower on the other side of the boundary, no light can pass through and all of the light is reflected. The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which the total internal reflection occurs.
A gas ionization process where an initially very small amount of free electrons, accelerated by a sufficiently strong electric field, give rise to electrical conduction through a gas by avalanche multiplication: when the number of free charges drops or the electric field weakens, the phenomena ceases.
The loss of water vapour from parts of plants (similar to sweating), especially in leaves but also in stems, flowers and roots. Leaf surfaces are dotted with openings called, collectively, stomata. Leaf transpiration occurs through stomata, and can be thought of as a necessary 'cost' associated with the opening of the stomata to allow the diffusion of carbon dioxide gas from the air for photosynthesis. Transpiration also cools plants and enables mass flow of mineral nutrients and water from roots to shoots.
A material degradation process due to the combined effect of corrosion and wear.
A type of contact electrification in which certain materials become electrically charged after they come into contact with another different material and are then separated (such as through rubbing). The polarity and strength of the charges produced differ according to the materials, surface roughness, temperature, strain, and other properties.
An optical phenomenon in which light is generated via the breaking of asymmetrical bonds in a crystal when that material is scratched, crushed, or rubbed. This is a variant of luminescence.
A radioactive isotope of hydrogen. The nucleus of tritium contains one proton and two neutrons, whereas the nucleus of protium (by far the most abundant hydrogen isotope) contains one proton and no neutrons. Tritium decays into helium-3 by beta decay.
A water-powered gas compressor. A vertical pipe or shaft goes down to a separation chamber, a pipe coming away from that chamber allows the water to exit at a lower level, and another pipe coming from the chamber allows the compressed air to exit as needed. The compressed air is both cool and dry.
A device to stabilise against violent motion caused by harmonic vibration. A tuned damper reduces the vibration of a system with a comparatively lightweight component so that the worst-case vibrations are less intense. Roughly speaking practical systems are tuned to either move the main mode away from a troubling excitation frequency, or to add damping to a resonance that is difficult or expensive to damp directly. .
A rotary engine that extracts energy from a fluid flow. The simplest turbines have one moving part, a rotor assembly, which is a shaft with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades, or the blades react to the flow, so that they rotate and impart energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and water wheels.
A device that turns a laminar flow into a turbulent flow.
A fluid regime characterised by chaotic, stochastic property changes. This includes low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and velocity in space and time (flow that is not turbulent is called laminar flow).
When small-scale turbulance eddies (or wave packets) dissipate, their energy is converted into heat.
A system containing a gas and a liquid with a meniscus separating the two phases (for example, but not limited to, a liquid containing bubbles of gas).
Light scattering by colloidal particles or particles in suspension
Abnormally high rise of a liquid and its penetration into capillary channels due to a high-intensity ultrasound field. Caused by the collapse of cavitation bubbles at the capillary inlet. A collaping bubble generates a liquid microjet, the penetration of which into capillary channel causes the height increment of the capillary liquid column. Summation of such increments lies behind the increase of a height and a velocity of the liquid rise in a capillary under the ultrasound action.
A type of electric motor powered by the ultrasonic vibration of a component, the stator, placed against another component, the rotor or slider depending on the scheme of operation (rotation or linear translation).
Vibration at ultrasonic frequencies.
Cyclic sound pressure with a frequency greater than the upper limit of human hearing. Although this limit varies from person to person, 20 kHz serves as a useful lower limit in describing ultrasound.
A U-shaped glass tube held vertically at fixed temperature. One arm of the U has a section of precise capillary. Above this is a bulb. Another bulb is lower down in the other arm. Liquid is drawn into the upper bulb by suction and allowed to flow through the capillary into the lower bulb. The time taken for the liquid to pass marks on each side of the upper bulb (indicating a known volume) is proportional to the kinematic viscosity.
A volume of space that is essentially empty of matter, such that its gaseous pressure is much less than atmospheric pressure. A perfect vacuum would be one with no particles in it at all, which is impossible to achieve in practice. Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they simply call 'vacuum' or 'free space', and use the term partial vacuum to refer to real vacuum.
A method of distillation whereby the pressure above the liquid mixture to be distilled is reduced to less than its vapour pressure (usually less than atmospheric pressure) causing evaporation of the most volatile liquid(s) (those with the lowest boiling points). This distillation method works on the principle that boiling occurs when the vapour pressure of a liquid exceeds the ambient pressure.
(VPS) A technology for etching and surface modification to create porous layers with high reproductibility and for cleaning and surface engineering of plastics, rubbers and natural fibres. This surface engineering can improve properties such as frictional behaviour, heat resistance, surface electrical conductivity, lubricity, cohesive strength of films, or dielectric constant, or it can make materials hydrophilic or hydrophobic.
A device that regulates the flow of a fluid (gases, liquids, fluidised solids, or slurries) by opening, closing, or partially obstructing various passageways.
The sum of the attractive or repulsive forces between molecules (or between parts of the same molecule) other than those due to covalent bonds or to the electrostatic interaction of ions with one another or with neutral molecules. Includes Keesom Force, Debye Force and London dispersion force.
(also referred to as shock collar, or shock egg) The creation of a visible condensation cloud caused by a sudden drop in air pressure. Occurs under the right atmospheric conditions - for example by an aircraft traveling at transonic speeds.
The pressure of a vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases in a closed system. All liquids and solids have a tendency to evaporate into a gaseous form, and all gases have a tendency to condense back to their liquid or solid form.
A brand name of fabric hook-and-loop fasteners. It consists of two layers: a 'hook' side, which is a piece of fabric covered with tiny hooks, and a 'loop' side, which is covered with even smaller and 'hairier' loops. When the two sides are pressed together, the hooks catch in the loops and hold the pieces together. When the layers are separated, the strips make a characteristic 'ripping' sound.
In a machine, the ratio between the distance moved by the point of effort to that of the point of load.
The reduction in fluid pressure that results when a fluid flows through a constricted section of pipe. The fluid velocity must increase through the constriction to satisfy the equation of continuity, while its pressure must decrease due to conservation of energy: the gain in kinetic energy is balanced by a drop in pressure or a pressure gradient force.
A vibrating string produces a sound whose frequency in most cases is constant. Therefore, since frequency characterizes the pitch, the sound produced is a constant note. Vibrating strings are the basis of any string instrument like guitar, cello, or piano.
Mechanical oscillations about an equilibrium point. The oscillations may be periodic such as the motion of a pendulum or random such as the movement of a tire on a gravel road.
An instrument that operates by measuring the damping of an oscillating electromechanical resonator immersed in a fluid whose viscosity is to be determined. The resonator generally oscillates in torsion or transversely (as a cantilever beam or tuning fork). The higher the viscosity, the larger the damping imposed on the resonator.

(or Inverse Magnetostrictive Effect) The change of the magnetic susceptibility of a material when subjected to a mechanical stress.
The property of exhibiting both viscous and elastic characteristics when undergoing deformation.

A shaped charge adapted from its original purpose of piercing thick steel armour to the task of accelerating shock waves. It slightly resembles a wind tunnel.
An aerodynamic surface, consisting of a small vane that creates a vortex. Vortex generators can be found on many devices, but the term is most often used in aircraft design. Vortex generators are likely to be found on the external surfaces of vehicles where flow separation is a potential problem because vortex generators delay flow separation.
A torus shaped vortex in a fluid i.e. a region where the fluid mostly spins around an imaginary axis line that forms a closed loop. The dominant flow in a vortex ring is said to be toroidal, more precisely poloidal. Within a stationary body of fluid, a vortex ring can travel for relatively long distance, carrying the spinning fluid with it.
Walking is defined by an 'inverted pendulum' gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs with each step. This applies regardless of the number of limbs - even arthropods with six, eight or more limbs.

The transport of energy by ocean surface waves, and the capture of that energy to do useful work  for example for electricity generation, water desalination, or the pumping of water (into reservoirs).
A structure which guides waves, such as electromagnetic waves or sound waves. There are different types of waveguide for each type of wave: electromagnetic, optical or acoustic.
Waveguides used at optical frequencies are typically dielectric waveguides, structures in which a dielectric material with high permittivity, and thus high index of refraction, is surrounded by a material with lower permittivity. The structure guides optical waves by total internal reflection. The most common optical waveguide is optical fibre.
Explotation of a natural or deliberately introduced weak point in a system or structure. For example: an electrical fuse or a shear pin.
The erosion of material from a solid surface by the action of another surface.
The breaking down of Earth's rocks, soils and minerals through direct contact with the planet's atmosphere. Weathering occurs in situ, or 'with no movement', and thus should not be confused with erosion, which involves the movement of rocks and minerals by agents such as water, ice, wind, and gravity.
A triangular shaped tool, a compound and portable inclined plane. It can be used to separate two objects, or portions of objects, lift an object, or hold an object in place. It operates by converting a force applied to the wide end into forces perpendicular to the inclined surfaces.
(or zero-g) is any condition equivalent to experiencing little or no acceleration or gravitational attraction, e.g., far from a planet, star, or other massive body, flying an outside loop.  From the equivalence principle for acceleration and gravitational attraction it follows that weightlessness can also be experienced in free fall, which is the cause of weightlessness of objects in orbit about the Earth.
A phenomenon that occurs when a spinning rod is placed into a solution of liquid polymer. Instead of being thrown outward, entanglements cause the polymer chains to be drawn towards the rod.
A process for joining materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, typically by melting the workpieces and adding a filler material to form a pool of molten material (the weld pool) that cools to become a strong joint, with pressure sometimes used in conjunction with heat, or by itself, to produce the weld (in contrast with soldering and brazing, which involve melting a lower-melting-point material between the workpieces, without melting the workpieces.
The ability of a liquid to maintain contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Adhesive forces between a liquid and solid cause a liquid drop to spread across the surface. Cohesive forces within the liquid cause the drop to ball up and avoid contact with the surface.
A measuring instrument used to measure an unknown electrical resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit, one leg of which includes the unknown component. Its operation is similar to the original potentiometer except that in potentiometer circuits the meter used is a sensitive galvanometer.
A circular device capable of rotating on its axis, typically facilitating movement whilst supporting a load, or performing useful work.
A simple torque multiplier consisting of a wheel turned by an axle (or an axle turned by a wheel)
A magnetoelastic effect. The twisting of a magnetic material when a helical magnetic field is applied to it.
Generation of electrical pulses when a specially processed wire is moved in a magnetic field. The wire has two distinct magnetic regions that react differently to the magnetic field: the shell requires a strong magnetic field to reverse its magnetic polarity, whereas the core will revert under weaker field conditions. The polarity of the wire shifts very rapidly, generating strong, short (~10 µs) electrical pulses without additional external power.
The flow of air or other gases that compose an atmosphere
The apparent temperature felt on exposed skin, which is a function of the air temperature and wind speed. The wind chill temperature (often popularly called The wind chill factor) is always lower than the air temperature, except at higher temperatures where wind chill is considered less important.
The conversion of wind energy into a useful form of energy, such as using wind turbines to make electricity, wind mills for mechanical power, wind pumps for pumping water or drainage, or sails to propel ships.
A vehicle that attains level flight near the surface of the Earth, made possible by a cushion of high-pressure air created by the aerodynamic interaction between the wings and the surface (ground effect).

X-rays have a wavelength in the range of 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3 × 1016 Hz to 3 × 1019 Hz) and energies in the range 120 eV to 120 keV. They are shorter in wavelength than UV rays and longer than gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is called Röntgen radiation.
A force acting on a rotating body in space caused by the anisotropic emission of thermal photons, which carry momentum. It is usually considered in relation to meteoroids or small asteroids (about 10 cm to 10 km in diameter), as its influence is most significant for these bodies.
A viscosity measurement device widely used in the paint industry. It is commonly a stainless steel cup with a tiny hole drilled in the center of the bottom of the cup. To determine the viscosity of a liquid, the cup is dipped and completely filled with the substance. After lifting the cup out of the substance the user measures the time until the liquid streaming out of it breaks up. This time is then converted to kinematic viscosity.
The splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of a static magnetic field. The Zeeman effect is very important in applications such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Mössbauer spectroscopy. It may also be utilised to improve accuracy in Atomic absorption spectroscopy.
Microporous, aluminosilicate minerals commonly used as commercial adsorbents. Widely used in industry for water purification, as catalysts, for the preparation of advanced materials and in nuclear reprocessing.
A material, structure or system that does not expand or contract in response to changes in temperature.
A device used to focus electromagnetic ratiation (including light), using diffraction instead of refraction. It consists of a set of radially symmetric rings which alternate between opaque and transparent. Incident radiation diffracts around the opaque zones which can be spaced so that the diffracted radiation constructively interferes at a desired focus, creating an image there.
