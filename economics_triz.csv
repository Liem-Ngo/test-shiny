Make an object porous or add porous elements (inserts, coatings, etc.).<br> - Think of the customer-facing layers of a company as a porous membrane which filters information flow both into and out of the organisation<br> - Improve internal communications by creating Intranet accessible by all hierarchical layers, giving workers access to CEO and vice-versa.<br> - ‘Trickle-down’ economics<br> - Government ‘leaks’ - used as a way of gauging public reaction to (usually) controversial issues<br>B. If an object is already porous, use the pores to introduce a useful substance or function.<br> - Empower the customer facing layer (information is the thing that fills the pores - see 30A).<br> - Use mind-maps, self-patterning capabilities, etc to improve the information/knowledge intake and filtering abilities of the brain<br> - Media relations department turns spin-doctor and/or marketing feedback gatherer
A. Change the color of an object or its external environment.<br> - Red/Blue proposal preparation teams<br> - Use of lighting effects to change mood in a room or office<br> - Six Thinking Hats<br> - Creation of ‘corporate colours’ - creating a strong brand image through use of bespoke colours - ‘BP green’, ‘British Telecom red’ phone boxes, ‘Ford blue’, etc<br> - Use colours to communicate state of alert (green, black, amber, red, etc)<br> - Highlighter pens<br>B. Change the transparency of an object or its external environment.<br> - ‘Transparent’ organisations<br> - Transparent communications<br> - Importance of creating clear, concise mission statement<br> - Smoke-screen/mis-information to disguise confidential R&D etc activities
A. Make objects interact with a given object of the same material (or material with identical properties).<br> - Co-located project teams<br> - Internal customers<br> - Product branding/product families<br> - Boeing ‘Working Together Teams’ - bring customers and suppliers into design loop.<br> - ‘Constancy of Purpose’ (Point No. 1 of Deming’s Fourteen Points)<br> - ‘Singing from the same hymn sheet’<br> - Common data transfer protocols between different organisations<br> - ‘The best way to make a silk purse from a sow’s ear is to begin with a silk sow. The same is true of money’ (Augustine’s Law #1)
A. Make portions of an object that have fulfilled their functions go away (discard by dissolving, evaporating, etc.) or modify them directly during operation.<br> - Flexible, variable-sized project teams<br> - Load/capacity balance using contract labour<br> - Consultants<br> - Contract hire of specialised equipment/facilities, etc<br>B. Conversely, restore consumable parts of an object directly in operation.<br> - Need to periodically re-energise continuous improvement initiatives (‘enthusiasm injections’)<br> - Life-long learning (where individuals are given responsibility for managing their own personal continuing education, ensuring skills remain up to date)<br> - ‘In a start-up company, you basically throw out all assumptions every three weeks.’ Scott McNealy
A. Change an object's physical state (e.g. to a gas, liquid, or solid).<br> - Virtual prototyping<br> - Numerical simulation<br> - Virtual shopping - E.g. Amazon.com<br> - Telephone banking<br> - Electronic voting in elections<br>B. Change the concentration or consistency.<br> - ‘Six Thinking Hats’<br> - ‘Six Action Shoes’<br> - Change the team structure (e.g. football teams use substitutes)<br> - Stores introduce ‘special offers’ and other promotions<br>C. Change the degree of flexibility.<br> - Introduce intelligence into on-line catalogues (e.g. first generation catalogues were replicas of previous paper versions, latest generation incorporate search engines, expert systems, etc)<br> - Software with options for ‘beginner’ through to ‘expert’ usage<br> - Moves away from fixed clothing size partitions -E.g. ‘Personal Pairs’ - a customer at a participating store chooses which fabric he/she wants, then is measured. Those measurements are transmitted instantly to a Levi's plant in Tennessee where the data controls a laser cutter. The bar-coded pieces are stitched on the regular assembly line, and mailed directly to the customer. (The custom Levi’s, which customers love, run about $15 more than off-the-rack ones)<br>D. Change the temperature.<br> - Get customers excited (‘hot’) about the product by giving them ownership of the change<br> - Get employees excited about the future of the company by using full involvement strategic planning, or stock options, or… etc.<br> - ‘A fired-up team wins games even if it’s not the best team. A fired-up company can achieve the same result’
A. Use phenomena occurring during phase transitions. (Awareness of macro-scale business phenomena)<br> - Awareness of the requirements of different stages - conception, birth, development, maturity, retirement - of a project (e.g. shifting manpower requirements, shifting budget requirements).<br> - Transition from a ‘bull’ to a ‘bear’ market.<br> - Tendency to relax after receiving a Quality Award, Innovation Award, etc.<br> - Forming/storming/norming/performing phases of team development -E.g. take advantage of enthusiasm dip during storming-norming
A. Use thermal expansion (or contraction) of materials.<br> - If employees are excited (‘hot’) each can do more in the space that expands to exist between them.<br> - ‘A fired-up, empowered, appreciated individual will do the work of three who aren’t’ Anon.<br> - ‘It seems safe to say that significant discovery, really creative thinking, does not occur with regard to problems about which the thinker is lukewarm’. Mary Henle<br>B. If thermal expansion is being used, use multiple materials with different coefficients of thermal expansion.<br> - Expand or contract marketing efforts depending on the product’s ‘hotness’ - rate of sales and profitability<br> - Personality matching on work-teams
A. Replace common air with oxygen-enriched air (enriched atmosphere)<br> - Risk and Revenue Sharing Partnerships<br> - Guest speakers at a seminar<br> - Use internal subject matter experts<br> - Use simulations/games instead of lecture-style training<br> - Use case-studies in training<br> - Injection of new-blood/new challenge into a team<br>B. Replace enriched air with pure oxygen (highly enriched atmosphere).<br> - Consider personal chemistry issues when assembling a project team - find people who will spark-off interesting reactions with each other.<br> - Deming’s 4 stages of learning - unconscious incompetence, conscious incompetence, conscious competence, unconscious competence<br> - Focus teams on a single project only (give them an enriched environment full of success factors<br> - ‘Leadership is a potent combination of strategy and character. But if you must be without one, be without strategy.’ General H. Norman, Schwartzkopff Expose air or oxygen to ionizing radiation,<br>D. Use ionized oxygen,<br>E. Replace ozonized (or ionized) oxygen with ozone (atmosphere enriched by ‘unstable’ elements)<br> - Corporate Jester<br> - ‘Devil’s Advocate’<br> - ‘I like Bartok and Stravinsky. It’s a discordant sound and there are discordant sounds inside a company. As president you must orchestrate the discordant sounds into a kind of harmony. But you never want too much harmony. One must cultivate a taste for finding harmony within discord or you will drift away from the forces that keep a company alive’ Takeo Fujisawa, Honda co-founder.
A. Replace a normal environment with an inert one.<br> - Moves away from the (normal) disruptive performance appraisal, merit award, and reward environment to an (emotionally neutral) more fair system of working practice.<br> - ‘TRIZ and People’<br> - Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind<br> - Time-out during negotiation<br> - ‘Away-day’s/ team-building days<br> - Corporate Retreats<br> - Operations Room -E.g. for planning organisational change, proposal submissions, contract tendering, etc.<br>B. Add neutral parts, or inert additives to an object.<br> - Use of neutral third parties during difficult negotiations (e.g. Senator George Mitchell in Northern Ireland, ACAS, etc.)<br> - Introduction of ‘quiet areas’ into the workplace.<br> - Rest breaks/’pause for reflection’ breaks in meetings.
A. Change from uniform to composite (multiple) structures. (Awareness and utilisation of combinations of different skills and capabilities.)<br> - Multi-disciplinary project teams.<br> - Do training with a combination of lecture, simulations, on-line learning, video, etc.<br> - Employ different personality types (e.g. Myers-Briggs) on a team<br> - Hard person/soft person negotiating team.<br> - ‘Post-capitalist Society’<br> - ‘Small is beautiful’ - appreciation for diverse, interconnected systems<br> - Mix of thinking skills in a project team (e.g. Basadur, De Bono’s ‘Six Thinking Hats‘ and ‘Six Action Shoes’)<br> - Positional players in a football team<br> - Combined high risk/low risk investment strategy
